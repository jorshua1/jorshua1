# Hi, I'm Jorshua Hernandez

I'm currently trying to relearn everything about web development, got a interest in mobile development but currently more interested in Android than IOS

I made this account only to keep track of my learning progress, but in the future i hope to be a contribuitor in the community so please keep an eye in my progress, if you got a suggestion about anything let me know so i can keep that in mind and probably get a little better in later interactions
***
> in my mind, the go-to goal is getting at least a walkaround of what is to be a full-stack developer but i'm more interested in the whole backend thing so i'll be working first in the frontend side but also giving a look sometimes to the backend side so i could star getting a idea of that world
***
#### With that in mind, this is the track i'll be following
1.  HTML
> Basic html structure and technical stuff
2.  CSS
> Basic CSS, same as html
3.  Applied Design 
> Learning how to combine typographics, colors, graphics, animations, page design and others stuffs
4.  Applied Accessibility
> Like the name says
5.  Principles of Web Design
> More like responsive web design thing
6.  CSS Layouts
> Flexbox and css grid FTW
7.  Project Time
> A set of five projects, maybe a little extra in form of startpage or a landing page

> i hope get this things learned in at least one week or two max
